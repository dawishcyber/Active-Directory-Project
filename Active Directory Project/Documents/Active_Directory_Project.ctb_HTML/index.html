<div class='page'><h1 class='title level-1'>Active Directory Project</h1><br/></div><div class='page'><h1 class='title level-2'>Introduction</h1><br/><p></p><p><strong><h3>Project Overview</h3></strong></p><p>This project demonstrates my understanding of <strong>Active Directory (AD)</strong> administration, including tasks such as configuring security settings, managing users and groups, and performing basic vulnerability assessments within an Active Directory environment. Through this project, I aim to showcase essential administrative skills in Active Directory, which is widely used in enterprise settings to manage and control multiple devices and users across an organization.</p><p></p><p><strong>Active Directory (AD)</strong> is a tool developed by Microsoft that allows administrators to manage and secure resources, users, and devices within a networked environment. It is especially valuable in enterprise networks with multiple domains and devices because it centralizes control, improving the efficiency and security of large-scale IT environments.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><h3>Core Concepts in Active Directory</h3></strong></p><p></p><p><strong><h4>Domains</h4></strong></p><p>A domain is the fundamental organizational unit within an Active Directory structure, used to manage and control all network resources, including user accounts, computers, printers, and other devices. Domains allow administrators to enforce policies and permissions across all devices within the network.</p><p>Examples of domain controllers include Windows Server editions (such as Windows Server 2019 or 2022), which help manage domain authentication, security policies, and resource access within an Active Directory environment.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><h4>Windows Clients</h4></strong></p><p>Windows clients refer to individual workstations and laptops running Microsoft’s Windows OS that are integrated into an Active Directory domain. Devices like Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs can join a domain, allowing them to be centrally managed and controlled by administrators.</p><p>Administrators can control settings, enforce security policies, and push software updates across all connected Windows clients, providing a streamlined way to manage large numbers of computers from a central location.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h3>Project Tools and Technologies</h3><ol><li><strong>Virtual Machines (VirtualBox):</strong></li></ol></p><p>VirtualBox was used to create isolated virtual environments for the Windows Server (acting as the domain controller) and Windows client systems. This setup enabled the creation of a simulated enterprise network environment without impacting any production systems.</p><p><ol><li><strong>Windows Server:</strong></li></ol></p><p>A virtual machine running Windows Server was configured to serve as the domain controller. This machine managed the Active Directory environment, including the configuration of roles, domain setup, security settings, and implementation of group policies.</p><p><ol><li><strong>Windows Clients:</strong></li></ol></p><p>Windows 10 or Windows 11 virtual machines acted as client devices within the network. These clients joined the Active Directory domain and were used to demonstrate user and group management, policy enforcement, and device administration.</p><p><ol><li><strong>CherryTree:</strong></li></ol></p><p>CherryTree, a hierarchical note-taking application, was utilized for documenting configurations, processes, and observations throughout the project.</p><p><ol><li><strong>Greenshot:</strong></li></ol></p><p>Greenshot, a lightweight screenshot tool, was used to capture images and document visual aspects of the configurations and processes during the project for reporting and reference purposes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>This project will not only demonstrate my ability to perform fundamental AD administrative tasks but will also highlight my understanding of security configurations and vulnerability analysis using BloodHound and SharpHound. By the end, I aim to have a well-documented setup of an AD environment with controlled access, applied security settings within an enterprise-like environment.</p><p></p></div><div class='page'><h1 class='title level-2'>Lab Environment Setup</h1><br/><p></p><p><strong><h3>Description</h3></strong></p><p>The <strong>lab environment setup</strong> for this project will involve several key steps designed to simulate a real-world enterprise network within a virtualized environment. This setup will include the installation of virtual machines, configuration of network settings, and the installation of Windows Server and Windows client operating systems to create an Active Directory (AD) domain environment. The lab environment will provide a controlled setting for practicing AD administrative tasks, security configurations, and vulnerability assessments without affecting any live systems.</p><p></p><p><strong><h4>Key Setup Steps</h4></strong><ol><li><strong>Installation of Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>:</li><li><strong>Virtualization Software</strong>: To create the lab, I will use <strong>VirtualBox</strong> (or an alternative like VMware Workstation) as the virtualization platform. VirtualBox enables me to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical computer, simulating different roles within a networked environment.</li><li><strong>Creating VMs for Server and Clients</strong>: Separate VMs will be created to represent a Windows Server (which will act as the Domain Controller) and several Windows clients. Each virtual machine will be configured with resources like CPU, RAM, and storage according to the requirements of the operating system it will run.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li><strong>Configuration of Network Settings</strong>:</li><li><strong>Network Mode</strong>: Virtual machines will be connected using a <strong>“Host-Only”</strong> or <strong>“Internal Network”</strong> mode, which ensures that the VMs can communicate with each other without needing external internet access, creating an isolated network.</li><li><strong>IP Address Allocation</strong>: IP addresses will be manually assigned to each VM or managed via a DHCP server on the Windows Server. This setup will replicate a small office network and allow for seamless communication within the domain.</li><li><strong>Domain Controller Configuration</strong>: The Windows Server will be configured to serve as a domain controller within the network, managing the Active Directory domain and ensuring all client machines can authenticate and communicate within this domain environment.</li></ol></p><p></p><p><ol><li> <strong>Installation of Windows Server</strong>:</li><li><strong>Operating System Installation</strong>: A VM will be installed with <strong>Windows Server</strong> (e.g., Windows Server 2019 or 2022) to act as the domain controller. This server will host the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role, which is responsible for managing the domain.</li><li><strong>Active Directory Setup</strong>: After installation, the AD DS role will be configured on the server, establishing a new domain (e.g., <em>lab.local</em>) to which client machines will be added. This will involve setting up the forest, domain name, and additional configurations necessary for AD functionality.</li><li><strong>DNS and DHCP Services</strong>: The server will also be configured to manage DNS and, optionally, DHCP, allowing it to handle both name resolution and dynamic IP address allocation within the virtual network. DNS is essential for AD operations, as it allows client machines to locate the domain controller for authentication and resource access.</li></ol></p><p></p><p><ol><li> <strong>Installation of Windows Client Operating Systems</strong>:</li><li><strong>Client VMs</strong>: Separate virtual machines running Windows 10 or Windows 11 will be created to act as domain-joined clients. These VMs simulate the workstations and laptops typically found in an enterprise environment.</li><li><strong>Domain Joining Process</strong>: Each client machine will be configured to join the domain established on the Windows Server. This will allow administrators to apply security policies, manage user accounts, and enforce permissions from a central location.</li><li><strong>User and Group Policies</strong>: Once the clients are added to the domain, group policies and security configurations can be applied to these machines from the domain controller, replicating a realistic enterprise control setup.</li></ol></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><h4>Expected Outcome</h4></strong></p><p>At the end of this setup phase, I will have a functioning Active Directory environment that replicates a small enterprise network. This environment will consist of:<ul><li>A centralized <strong>Windows Server</strong> configured as the domain controller and managing AD services, DNS, and potentially DHCP.</li><li>Multiple <strong>Windows client machines</strong> integrated into the domain, ready for AD management tasks, policy enforcement, and security configurations.</li><li>A secure network configuration that isolates the lab environment and facilitates controlled testing and experimentation with AD management and security practices.</li></ul></p><p></p><p>This lab environment will provide a comprehensive foundation for experimenting with AD administration, configuring user and group permissions, applying security policies, and identifying potential vulnerabilities within the domain, all while documenting each step for reference and learning.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><div class='page'><h1 class='title level-3'>Installation of Virtual Machines (VMs)</h1><br/><p><h2>Downloan the Virtual box at Oracel website. </h2></p><p></p><p>I downloaded VirtualBox from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html">Oracle’s website</a>, including both the <strong>Oracle VM VirtualBox Base Package (version 7.0.22)</strong> and the <strong>Extension Pack</strong>.

Therefore the single client will be used for all objects.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/10-1.png" alt="images/10-1.png" /></p><p></p><p><h3>Creating an “Account Lockout Policy”</h3></p><p></p><p><h3>Why?</h3></p><p></p><p>Applying an <strong>Account Lockout Policy</strong> is an important security measure designed to prevent unauthorized access to accounts within a domain. Here’s why it&#39;s beneficial:<ol><li><strong>Protection Against Brute-Force Attacks</strong>:</li><li>An account lockout policy helps protect against brute-force attacks, where an attacker attempts multiple password guesses to gain access to user accounts. By limiting the number of failed login attempts, it reduces the risk of attackers guessing passwords through repeated attempts.</li></ol></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Mitigates Insider Threats</strong>:</li><li>In addition to external threats, an account lockout policy helps guard against potential misuse by insiders who may try to access unauthorized accounts within the network.</li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Alerts to Potential Security Incidents</strong>:</li><li>Frequent account lockouts can signal attempted unauthorized access. Administrators can investigate repeated lockouts as potential indicators of attempted attacks or misconfigurations in the system.</li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Maintains Compliance</strong>:</li><li>Many organizations must adhere to security standards and compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and ISO standards) that mandate controls for user authentication, including account lockout settings.</li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Enhances Security for Remote Access</strong>:</li><li>With many users accessing corporate networks remotely, account lockout policies add an extra layer of security against external login attempts that could compromise sensitive resources.</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p>However, while an account lockout policy enhances security, it must be configured with balance. Setting the <strong>lockout threshold</strong> too low can lead to users being locked out by accidental login mistakes, while setting it too high may not provide adequate protection against guessing attacks.</p><p></p><p>To set this policy, I right-clicked on the “Default Domain Policy” and then clicked on “Edit.”</p><p></p><p><img src="images/10-2.png" alt="images/10-2.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p>Here, I navigated from “Computer Configuration” to “Account Policy” and then selected “Account Lockout Policy.”</p><p></p><p><img src="images/10-3.png" alt="images/10-3.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p>I then edited the policy settings.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/10-4.png" alt="images/10-4.png" /></p><p></p><p>And these are the final policy settings:</p><p><img src="images/10-5.png" alt="images/10-5.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p><h3>Creating Password Policy</h3></p><p></p><p><h3>Why?</h3></p><p>Creating a <strong>Password Policy</strong> is essential to secure accounts and protect sensitive information within an organization’s network. Here are the key reasons for implementing a password policy:<ol><li><strong>Prevents Easy-to-Guess Passwords</strong>:</li><li>A strong password policy requires users to create complex passwords that are difficult for attackers to guess or brute-force. By enforcing length, character variety, and other requirements, the policy reduces the chances of weak passwords like &quot;password123&quot; or &quot;admin.&quot;</li></ol></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Protects Against Unauthorized Access</strong>:</li><li>Password policies prevent unauthorized access by ensuring that each user account has a secure password. This makes it harder for attackers to break into accounts and gain access to sensitive resources or systems.</li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Reduces Impact of Phishing Attacks</strong>:</li><li>By enforcing regular password changes, the policy limits the effectiveness of phishing attacks. Even if a password is stolen, requiring users to update passwords regularly reduces the timeframe an attacker can use it.</li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Limits Risks of Reused Passwords</strong>:</li><li>Password policies can prevent users from reusing passwords. Since reused passwords are often used across multiple sites, preventing reuse reduces the risk if another site suffers a data breach that exposes passwords.</li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Supports Regulatory Compliance</strong>:</li><li>Many regulations and standards (like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS) require organizations to implement password policies as part of their security protocols to protect customer data and sensitive information.</li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Mitigates Insider Threats</strong>:</li><li>A strong password policy also protects against potential threats from insiders by ensuring all users follow the same security standards, reducing the likelihood of weak or shared passwords that could lead to unauthorized access.</li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li><strong>Encourages Good Security Habits</strong>:</li><li>A password policy can serve as an educational tool, helping users understand the importance of strong passwords and encouraging better password management practices, such as avoiding common passwords and using secure password storage methods.</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p>By implementing a password policy, organizations can enforce security standards that protect their systems, maintain compliance, and encourage users to follow good password practices, ultimately strengthening overall network security.</p><p></p><p>I clicked on “Password Policy” and edited the “Policy Settings.”</p><p><img src="images/10-6.png" alt="images/10-6.png" /></p><p></p><p>Here are the edited “Policy Settings”:</p><p><img src="images/10-7.png" alt="images/10-7.png" /></p><p></p><p>I also set up a CMD Disable Policy to prevent users from running the command line.</p><p>I navigated to the “System Policy” under User Configuration, and then clicked on “Prevent access to the Command Prompt.”</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/10-8.png" alt="images/10-8.png" /></p><p></p><p>I selected “Enabled,” clicked on “Apply,” and then clicked on “OK.”</p><p><img src="images/10-9.png" alt="images/10-9.png" /></p><p></p><p>These are a few of the policies I created.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/10-10.png" alt="images/10-10.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/10-11.png" alt="images/10-11.png" /></p><p></p><p></p></div><div class='page'><h1 class='title level-2'>Create a Share Folders and Files</h1><br/><p><strong>Creating a Shared Drive</strong></p><p>Creating a shared drive allows multiple users or departments to access and collaborate on files centrally stored on the server.
